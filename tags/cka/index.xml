This happened to be one of the most enjoyable certifications I have completed in recent memory.
If you are looking to learn more about:
how to deploy Kubernetes, how to troubleshoot common Kubernetes issues, or how to perform a wide range of administative tasks inside of Kubernetes then this certification is right for you. Since I did not have any experience with Kubernetes before purchasing this exam, I did some research and opted to purchase a subscription to Kode Kloud to bolster my knowledge.</description></item></channel></rss>
