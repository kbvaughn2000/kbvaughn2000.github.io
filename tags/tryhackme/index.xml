Below are the steps taken to root this box.
First, I enumerated the open TCP ports with threader3000.
Next, I enumerated the ports with nmap -A -p 22,80 [machine ip].
It appears there is a website running on port 80. I visited the site to see what I could find.
It appears you are looking for ingredients for a recipe, and need to log into the victim computer to find them.</description></item><item><title>Wonderland - TryHackMe</title><link>https://www.kielvaughn.com/ctfs/2020-07-24-wonderland/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.kielvaughn.com/ctfs/2020-07-24-wonderland/</guid><description>Wonderland is a medium difficulty box on TryHackMe.

Below are the steps involved to fully compromise this box.
First, let&amp;rsquo;s see what ports are open by running threader3000 and entering the IP address of our victim.
Next, let&amp;rsquo;s run nmap -A -p 22,5001 [machine ip] to further enumerate these ports to see what is running. We ran threader first as it is able to find open TCP ports quickly, which in turn allows us to narrow the range that nmap is scanning, which speeds up its runtime as well.</description></item><item><title> Overpass - TryHackMe</title><link>https://www.kielvaughn.com/ctfs/2020-07-18-overpass/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.kielvaughn.com/ctfs/2020-07-18-overpass/</guid><description>Overpass is an easy difficulty box on TryHackMe.
