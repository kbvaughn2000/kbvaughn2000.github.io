Below are the steps involved to fully compromise this box.
First, let&amp;rsquo;s see what ports are open by running threader3000 and entering the IP address of our victim.
Next, let&amp;rsquo;s run nmap -A -p 22,5001 [machine ip] to further enumerate these ports to see what is running. We ran threader first as it is able to find open TCP ports quickly, which in turn allows us to narrow the range that nmap is scanning, which speeds up its runtime as well.</description></item></channel></rss>
