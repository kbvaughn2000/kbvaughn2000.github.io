Below are the steps taken to root the box.
First, I ran Threader3000 on this box and it returns 3 open ports.
Next, I ran nmap -A -p 21,22,80 to better enumerate these ports and gain more info on what is running.
Next, I visited the website to see what was present. The website pulled up the default web page for Apache2.</description></item><item><title> Nax - TryHackMe</title><link>http://www.kielvaughn.com/ctfs/2020-07-17-nax/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://www.kielvaughn.com/ctfs/2020-07-17-nax/</guid><description>Nax is a medium difficulty box on TryHackMe. Below is a step by step walkthrough to root this box.
Let&amp;rsquo;s start by running nmap -A [machine ip]. We end up with the following results.
It looks like there&amp;rsquo;s sites running both on http and https, let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at both of them to see what&amp;rsquo;s going on. Both sites show the same page as shown below.
However, a review of the source code reveals a comment with a possible subdirectory to look at.</description></item><item><title> Lian Yu - TryHackMe</title><link>http://www.kielvaughn.com/ctfs/2020-07-13-lian-yu/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://www.kielvaughn.com/ctfs/2020-07-13-lian-yu/</guid><description>Lian Yu is another beginner level challenge on TryHackMe. Below is a walkthrough to Find all the flags.
First, let&amp;rsquo;s run nmap with nmap -sC -sV -T4 [machine ip]
It appears that there is ftp, ssh, tcp, and rpc open. Let&amp;rsquo;s start by taking a look at the website in a web browser. It appears that this website is based on the DC comic book hero, Arrow.
Let&amp;rsquo;s use gobuster to enumerate the website with gobuster dir -u [machine ip] -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-lowercase-2.</description></item></channel></rss>
