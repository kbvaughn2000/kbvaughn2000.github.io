This certification was an awesome experience and it helped me bolster my knowledge about several facets of IT Security.
If you are looking to learn more about:
the incident response process, current tools used by cyber criminals, or defenses against common attacks occurring today, then this certification and its material are right for you. I have taken a significant amount of certifications over the last few years (almost 20 in all), and I feel that this one was as beneficial to me from a technical standpoint as the CISSP was from a managerial standpoint.</description></item></channel></rss>
