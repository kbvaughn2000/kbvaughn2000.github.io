Below are the steps taken to root the box.
First, I ran Threader3000 on this box and it returns 3 open ports.
Next, I ran nmap -A -p 21,22,80 to better enumerate these ports and gain more info on what is running.
Next, I visited the website to see what was present. The website pulled up the default web page for Apache2.</description></item></channel></rss>
