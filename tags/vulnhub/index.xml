Below are the steps taken to compromise this box.
First, I enumerated open ports with threader3000.
Next, I ran nmap -A -p 21,22,80,65535 [machine ip] to enumerate the ports to find out more details about what services were running on them.
It appears that there is an FTP server available with anonymous access, 2 HTTP servers on ports 80 and 65535, and SSH open.</description></item><item><title>Misdirection - VulnHub</title><link>http://www.kielvaughn.com/ctfs/2020-07-30-misdirection/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://www.kielvaughn.com/ctfs/2020-07-30-misdirection/</guid><description>Misdirection is labelled as a medium difficulty OSCP style box from VulnHub. Below are the steps I took to root this box.
First, I ran threader3000 to see what ports were open.
Next, let&amp;rsquo;s run nmap -A p- 22,80,3306,8080 [machine ip] to further enumerate these ports.
It appears that we have both Apache and a Python HTTP server running, along with MySQL and SSH. Let&amp;rsquo;s visit both webpages over ports 80 and 8080 and see what&amp;rsquo;s going on.</description></item><item><title>symfonos2 - Vulnhub Boot2Root</title><link>http://www.kielvaughn.com/ctfs/2020-06-28-symfonos2-walkthrough/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://www.kielvaughn.com/ctfs/2020-06-28-symfonos2-walkthrough/</guid><description>Another series I ran across on vulnhub is the symfonos series, which is a total of 6 boxes of increasing difficulty.

This can also be discovered running netdiscover -i eth0 as shown below:</description></item><item><title>symfonos1 - Vulnhub Boot2Root</title><link>http://www.kielvaughn.com/ctfs/2020-06-27-symfonos1-walkthrough/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://www.kielvaughn.com/ctfs/2020-06-27-symfonos1-walkthrough/</guid><description>Another series I ran across on vulnhub is the symfonos series, which is a total of 6 boxes of increasing difficulty.

Reconnaissance &amp;amp; Scanning After importing into VMware Workstation and booting up the machine, I ran netdiscover -i eth0 to find the IP address of the machine.
Now that we have located the IP address of our target, we can proceed with performing an nmap scan to search for open ports, protocols and their versions.</description></item><item><title>Glasgow Smile - Vulnhub Boot2Root</title><link>http://www.kielvaughn.com/ctfs/2020-06-25-glasgow-smile-walkthrough/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://www.kielvaughn.com/ctfs/2020-06-25-glasgow-smile-walkthrough/</guid><description>In order to start preparing for my eventual goal of completing the OSCP, I have started to do my best to break into various boxes found on the Vulnhub website.
The first box I selected was named Glasgow Smile, which is labeled as an OSCP style box with several flags of varying challenge levels from easy to intermediate.
