Below is a walkthrough to compromise this machine.
First, after downloading and importing the machine into VMware, I had to figure out the IP address of the machine. I used netdiscover -i eth0 until I came across the IP of this machine.
After uncovering the IP address, I ran threader3000 and let it run its suggested nmap scan.</description></item><item><title>Stapler 1</title><link>http://www.kielvaughn.com/ctfs/2020-08-15-stapler/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://www.kielvaughn.com/ctfs/2020-08-15-stapler/</guid><description>Stapler 1 is a vulnerable machine found on the NetSecFocus Trophy Room list which I have been using as preparation for the OSCP.

Below are the steps taken to compromise this box.
First, I enumerated open ports with threader3000.
Next, I ran nmap -A -p 21,22,80,65535 [machine ip] to enumerate the ports to find out more details about what services were running on them.
It appears that there is an FTP server available with anonymous access, 2 HTTP servers on ports 80 and 65535, and SSH open.</description></item><item><title>Misdirection - VulnHub</title><link>http://www.kielvaughn.com/ctfs/2020-07-30-misdirection/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://www.kielvaughn.com/ctfs/2020-07-30-misdirection/</guid><description>Misdirection is labelled as a medium difficulty OSCP style box from VulnHub. Below are the steps I took to root this box.
First, I ran threader3000 to see what ports were open.
Next, let&amp;rsquo;s run nmap -A p- 22,80,3306,8080 [machine ip] to further enumerate these ports.
It appears that we have both Apache and a Python HTTP server running, along with MySQL and SSH. Let&amp;rsquo;s visit both webpages over ports 80 and 8080 and see what&amp;rsquo;s going on.</description></item><item><title>Pickle Rick - TryHackMe</title><link>http://www.kielvaughn.com/ctfs/2020-07-26-pickle-rick/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://www.kielvaughn.com/ctfs/2020-07-26-pickle-rick/</guid><description>Pickle Rick is an easy rated difficulty box on TryHackMe. Below are the steps taken to root this box.
First, I enumerated the open TCP ports with threader3000.
Next, I enumerated the ports with nmap -A -p 22,80 [machine ip].
It appears there is a website running on port 80. I visited the site to see what I could find.
It appears you are looking for ingredients for a recipe, and need to log into the victim computer to find them.</description></item><item><title>Wonderland - TryHackMe</title><link>http://www.kielvaughn.com/ctfs/2020-07-24-wonderland/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://www.kielvaughn.com/ctfs/2020-07-24-wonderland/</guid><description>Wonderland is a medium difficulty box on TryHackMe. Below are the steps taken to fully compromise this box.
First, let&amp;rsquo;s run threader3000 to see what ports are open.
This shows that two ports are open, 22 and 80. Let&amp;rsquo;s run nmap -A -p 22,80 [machine ip] and see what information we are able to enumerate from this scan.
It appears that Goland is used as the web server. Visiting the website we see a picture of a white rabbit.</description></item><item><title>Year of the Rabbit - TryHackMe</title><link>http://www.kielvaughn.com/ctfs/2020-07-23-year-of-the-rabbit/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://www.kielvaughn.com/ctfs/2020-07-23-year-of-the-rabbit/</guid><description>Year of the Rabbit is an easy difficulty box on TryHackMe. Below are the steps taken to root the box.
First, I ran Threader3000 on this box and it returns 3 open ports.
Next, I ran nmap -A -p 21,22,80 to better enumerate these ports and gain more info on what is running.
Next, I visited the website to see what was present. The website pulled up the default web page for Apache2.</description></item><item><title> Lian Yu - TryHackMe</title><link>http://www.kielvaughn.com/ctfs/2020-07-13-lian-yu/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://www.kielvaughn.com/ctfs/2020-07-13-lian-yu/</guid><description>Lian Yu is another beginner level challenge on TryHackMe. Below is a walkthrough to Find all the flags.
First, let&amp;rsquo;s run nmap with nmap -sC -sV -T4 [machine ip]
It appears that there is ftp, ssh, tcp, and rpc open. Let&amp;rsquo;s start by taking a look at the website in a web browser. It appears that this website is based on the DC comic book hero, Arrow.
Let&amp;rsquo;s use gobuster to enumerate the website with gobuster dir -u [machine ip] -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-lowercase-2.</description></item></channel></rss>
