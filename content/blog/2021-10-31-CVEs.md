A few months ago, Joe Helle made a [post](https://medium.com/cybersecpadawan/how-i-was-bored-one-night-and-found-two-cves-4233c3719194) about how he found some CVEs in open source software one night. I highly recommend reading his article, as it has a wealth of information on what to do if you find a vulnerability in a piece of software. While there is a shortage of people working in cybersecurity, it seems that employers are still very picky about filling these types of roles. Finding a CVE of your own can definitely help you stand out. Here's the two CVEs I was able to find:

# CVE-2021-38602

A stored cross site scripting vulnerability is present on the Article editing page in version 5.8.7 of PluXML. User input is not properly sanitized in multiple fields.

## Vulnerable Fields:

- Headline (optional):
- Content:

<img src="/images/PluXML_Create_Article.png" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;">

Once inserted, XSS can be triggered by visiting the posted article at the link mentioned under **Link to article:** near the top of the page.

<img src="/images/PluXML_Link_to_Article.png" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;">

### Headline Stored XSS Example

<hr class="terminal-divider">

<img src="/images/PluXML_Headline_Stored_XSS.png" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;">

### Content Stored XSS Example

# CVE-2021-38603

A stored cross site scripting vulnerability is present on the Profile edit page in the **Information:** field for each user.

## http://\<hostname/server ip\>/core/admin/profil.php

### Vulnerable Fields:

- Information:


<img src="/images/PluXML_Profile.png" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;">

Once inserted, XSS can be triggered by visiting any page/article created by that particular user.

There is a wealth of open source software out there that can be tested upon. Here's a few lists to get you started!
