The website pulled up the default web page for Apache2.</description></item><item><title>Erit Securus I - TryHackMe</title><link>https://www.kielvaughn.com/ctfs/2020-07-20-erit-securus/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.kielvaughn.com/ctfs/2020-07-20-erit-securus/</guid><description>Erit Securus I is an easy rated difficulty box on TryHackMe. Below are the steps taken to compromise this system.
Task 1 Task 1 just requires you to deploy the box and confirm that you have started it up.
Task 2 Task 2 asks you to scan the box, running nmap -A [machine ip] provides you with the answers to Question 1 and Question 2.
Task 3 There is only one question to answer for this task, which asks you what CMS is being utilized.</description></item><item><title> Haskhell - TryHackMe</title><link>https://www.kielvaughn.com/ctfs/2020-07-19-haskhell/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.kielvaughn.com/ctfs/2020-07-19-haskhell/</guid><description>Haskhell is a medium difficulty box from TryHackme. Below are the steps involved to fully compromise this box.
First, let&amp;rsquo;s see what ports are open by running threader3000 and entering the IP address of our victim.
Next, let&amp;rsquo;s run nmap -A -p 22,5001 [machine ip] to further enumerate these ports to see what is running. We ran threader first as it is able to find open TCP ports quickly, which in turn allows us to narrow the range that nmap is scanning, which speeds up its runtime as well.</description></item><item><title> Overpass - TryHackMe</title><link>https://www.kielvaughn.com/ctfs/2020-07-18-overpass/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.kielvaughn.com/ctfs/2020-07-18-overpass/</guid><description>Overpass is an easy difficulty box on TryHackMe.

Task 1 just requires deploying the machine, there is no challenge to solve.
Task 2 First, let&amp;rsquo;s run enumeration, the questions hint that non standard ports are used, so I ran nmap -p- [machine ip]. This took a bit to run since it was enumerating all the services on each port over the entire TCP port range.</description></item><item><title> Biohazard - TryHackMe</title><link>https://www.kielvaughn.com/ctfs/2020-07-14-biohazard/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.kielvaughn.com/ctfs/2020-07-14-biohazard/</guid><description>Biohazard is a medium difficulty box on TryHackMe.

various attacks and methods used today both by penetration testers and attackers, the penetration tester process, or basic web application attacks then this certification will be of benefit to you. I have taken a significant amount of certifications over the last few years (almost 20 in all), and I feel that this one was one of the most important ones I have earned so far.</description></item><item><title>GCIH - My Personal Experience</title><link>https://www.kielvaughn.com/posts/2020-05-17-gcih-experiences/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.kielvaughn.com/posts/2020-05-17-gcih-experiences/</guid><description>I recently successfully completed the GIAC GCIH certification.
