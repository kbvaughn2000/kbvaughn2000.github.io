I highly recommend reading his article, as it has a wealth of information on what to do if you find a vulnerability in a piece of software. While there is a shortage of people working in cybersecurity, it seems that employers are still very picky about filling these types of roles.</description></item><item><title>CEH Practical - My Personal Experience</title><link>http://www.kielvaughn.com/posts/2020-07-23-ceh-practical-my-personal-experience/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://www.kielvaughn.com/posts/2020-07-23-ceh-practical-my-personal-experience/</guid><description>Yesterday I successfully completed EC-Council&amp;rsquo;s CEH Practical exam.
While I had great things to say about my prior two certifications, this one left a sour taste in my mouth.
I was able to take this certification for relatively cheap, as EC-Council had a scholarship program for it on their website recently. I was selected as a recipient of their scholarship, and was informed that there was a $99 processing fee (likely to cover the costs of remote proctoring).</description></item><item><title>GPEN - My Personal Experience</title><link>http://www.kielvaughn.com/posts/2020-06-21-gpen-experiences/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://www.kielvaughn.com/posts/2020-06-21-gpen-experiences/</guid><description>Yesterday I successfully completed my GPEN certification, which was the elective I selected for the SANS Institute&amp;rsquo;s Applied Cybersecurity certificate program.
If you are looking to learn more about:
various attacks and methods used today both by penetration testers and attackers, the penetration tester process, or basic web application attacks then this certification will be of benefit to you. I have taken a significant amount of certifications over the last few years (almost 20 in all), and I feel that this one was one of the most important ones I have earned so far.</description></item><item><title>GCIH - My Personal Experience</title><link>http://www.kielvaughn.com/posts/2020-05-17-gcih-experiences/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://www.kielvaughn.com/posts/2020-05-17-gcih-experiences/</guid><description>I recently successfully completed the GIAC GCIH certification. This certification was an awesome experience and it helped me bolster my knowledge about several facets of IT Security.
If you are looking to learn more about:
the incident response process, current tools used by cyber criminals, or defenses against common attacks occurring today, then this certification and its material are right for you. I have taken a significant amount of certifications over the last few years (almost 20 in all), and I feel that this one was as beneficial to me from a technical standpoint as the CISSP was from a managerial standpoint.</description></item></channel></rss>
